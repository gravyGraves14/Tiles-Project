This project is a mimic of the NY Times tiles game. 
The player is supposed to click a square and choose 
another square that has similar colors.

Select your first tile, then select your second tile. When matches 
disappear (or don't because you did not match)
you must select your next first tile again to repeat the process.

There is a counter that tracks your current streak and longest streak.
If you mess up a match your current streak get set to zero again.
